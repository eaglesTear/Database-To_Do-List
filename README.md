# Database-To_Do-List
Using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js and EJS, I created a classic and simple to-do list that allows adding and deletion of items in this single page app. 

It utilises Atlas Cloud on the live app (found on my LinkedIn) to host my database on the back-end. 

You'll need Mongo spinning up to use this project without errors.
